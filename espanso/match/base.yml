# espanso match file

# For a complete introduction, visit the official docs at: https://espanso.org/docs/

# You can use this file to define the base matches (aka snippets)
# that will be available in every application when using espanso.

# Matches are substitution rules: when you type the "trigger" string
# it gets replaced by the "replace" string.
matches:
  # Simple text replacement
  - trigger: ":espanso"
    replace: "Hi there!"

  # NOTE: espanso uses YAML to define matches, so pay attention to the indentation!

  # But matches can also be dynamic:

  # Print the current date
  - trigger: ":date"
    replace: "{{mydate}}"
    vars:
      - name: mydate
        type: date
        params:
          format: "%d/%m/%Y"

  # Print the current time
  - trigger: ":now"
    replace: "{{mytime}}"
    vars:
      - name: mytime
        type: date
        params:
          format: "%H:%M"

  # Print time in 1 hour advance
  - trigger: ":+1h"
    replace: "{{mytime}}"
    vars:
      - name: mytime
        type: date
        params:
          format: "%H:%M"
          offset: 3600

  # Print time in 1 hour retardation
  - trigger: ":-1h"
    replace: "{{mytime}}"
    vars:
      - name: mytime
        type: date
        params:
          format: "%H:%M"
          offset: -3600

  # Print the tomorrow's date
  - trigger: ":tomorrow"
    replace: "{{mytime}}"
    label: "Insert tomorrow's date, such as 5-Jan-2022"
    vars:

    label: "Replace with proper LGBTQ+ name"

  # Communism explanation, as it could work
  - trigger: ":communism"
    replace: "[It could actually work](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/culture-online/case-studies/2022/sep/does-communism-work-if-so-why-not), as it does in China"

  # Session link and ID
  - trigger: ":session"
    replace: "Discord is proprietary and showed in the past that it can share your data with law enforcement. While this isn't a problem if you're not breaking the law, this also means that anytime FBI/CIA or so on ask for your data, they'll get it. It was proven that these organisations used this law very freely and abuse it in a lot of situations. I'm unsure how long Discord will work, and for more private stuff that I'm not sharing publicly download [Session](https://getsession.org/download). Which is as safe as Signal, but doesn't require a phone number [as you can read here](https://reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/jy3hjo/signal_vs_session_private_messenger/hgzef3y/?context=3) Once you've downloaded it, add me through this ID: `05d09cb614c750cccc33433e9ef15ccec6415aab21a2731cb13d060b809c53f77a`"

  # Codeberg link

    replace: "https://codeberg.org/nxtperfect/"
    label: "Insert link to my codeberg account"

  # Steam optimization

    replace: "mangohud MANGOHUD_CONFIG=cpu_temp,cpu_power,gpu_temp,gpu_power,vram,ram,swap,resolution,gamemode,font_size=13,round_corners=5,throttling_status gamemoderun %command%"
    label: "Commands to optimize steam games for linux"

  # Technożul
